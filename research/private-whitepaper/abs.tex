\begin{abstract}
	\noindent We describe Anysphere, a metadata-hiding communication system in practice. We discuss the theoretical protocol as well as security-critical implementation details. The goal of this whitepaper is to describe the threat model, and show how Anysphere guarantees privacy against all threats within the model.
