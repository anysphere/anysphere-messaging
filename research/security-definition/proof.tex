\section{Proof}
In this section, we prove that our messaging system satisfies \cref{defn:correctness}, \cref{defn:SIM-secure}, and \cref{defn:integrity}. These definitions establish correctness, security, and integrity respectively.
\subsection{Proof of Correctness}
To show \cref{defn:correctness}, we need to show our two consistency models: Consistent Prefix and Eventual Consistency.
