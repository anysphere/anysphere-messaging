In this paper, we prove the security of Anysphere, a metadata-private messaging(MPM) system we are developing. Our main innovations are 1) We describe a vulnerability of existing MPM implementations through a variation of the Compromised Friend(CF) attack proposed by Angel et. al. Our attack can compromise the exact metadata of any conversations between honest users. 2) We present a security definition for MPM systems assuming compromised friends. 3) We prove that Anysphere's core protocol satisfies our enhanced security definition.
