        # our security guarantees derive entirely from the client code. what the server is doing
        # does not matter at all — including if it multiplies by 0! the server gains no extra information,
        # and an external party gets no information it couldn't get otherwise (it knows that certain database
        # elements are 0, but it could have just gotten that by querying the server on its own). hence, as long
        # as we are careful in the client not to subtract a ciphertext from itself, or multiply by 0 (which we
        # never do; we never do any evaluation at all!) this is completely fine!

        # in fact, we do not even need this long explanation at all. the security proof is trivial: the index
        # of retrieval is encrypted, and hence, the server, or anyone else, will never know the index of retrieval,
        # regardless of what else happens.
        #
