# Anysphere Messaging

*The world's first completely private messenger. For freedom.*

A metadata-private communication system deployed in the real world. Using private information retrieval based on homomorphic encryption, our system guarantees metadata privacy even if all of our servers are compromised and any number of the users and network observers are malicious.

## GitPod
We support and use gitpod often. You can start here if you would like to try it out.

# [Bazel](https://bazel.build)

*{Fast, Correct} - Choose two*

Build and test software of any size, quickly and reliably.

* **Speed up your builds and tests**:
  Bazel rebuilds only what is necessary.
  With advanced local and distributed caching, optimized dependency analysis and
  parallel execution, you get fast and incremental builds.

* **One tool, multiple languages**: Build and test Java, C++, Android, iOS, Go,
  and a wide variety of other language platforms. Bazel runs on Windows, macOS,
  and Linux.

* **Scalable**: Bazel helps you scale your organization, codebase, and
  continuous integration solution. It handles codebases of any size, in multiple
  repositories or a huge monorepo.

* **Extensible to your needs**: Easily add support for new languages and
  platforms with Bazel's familiar extension language. Share and re-use language
  rules written by the growing Bazel community.
